# Automated Testing Project - Team Collaboration

## Project Overview

This collaborative project, named "theinternet-solvd," was undertaken by a team consisting of Pablo Rizzieri, Edgar Aguirre, Carolina Diaz, Sebastian Fermanelli, and Lucas Perez. Our objective was to automate five functionalities of the "The Internet" website using Selenium and TestNG within a one-week sprint. JIRA served as our project management tool, aiding in the creation of tickets to outline task details and requirements.

## Technologies Used

- **Selenium:** Employed for web browser automation, enabling interaction and control of web elements.

- **TestNG:** Used as our testing framework for structured and efficient test organization and execution.

- **JIRA:** Utilized for project management, ticket creation, task prioritization, and progress tracking.

## Functionalities Automated

1. **Form Authentication:**
    - Automated the login process to validate Form Authentication functionality.

2. **Key Presses:**
    - Tested key press interactions to ensure proper handling and functionality.

3. **JQuery:**
    - Automated interactions with JQuery elements on the website.

4. **Drag and Drop:**
    - Implemented automated tests to validate drag and drop functionality.

5. **File Upload:**
    - Automated the file upload process to ensure it works as expected.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`src/main/java`**: Contains the main source code for the automated tests.
- **`src/test/java`**: Holds the TestNG test classes for each functionality.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/theinternet-solvd.git
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Example using Maven
    cd theinternet-solvd
    mvn install
   
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   # Example using TestNG
    mvn test
   
## Reporting
- TestNG generates comprehensive test reports located in the target/surefire-reports/ directory. These reports provide insights into test results, including pass/fail status, execution time, and more.
